For this project, we used data analysis to see the overall performance of a fictional bicycle store and its products. Our goal was to practice our analytical skills and deliver a project that can help any retail store improve its performance. We were able to create tables on sales and customers, from which a report and a data visualization were made that are simple to comprehend.Â
